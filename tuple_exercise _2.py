# Exercise : This program counts the distribution of the hour of the day
# for each of the messages. You can pull the hour from the “From” line
# by finding the time string and then splitting that string into parts using
# the colon character. Once you have accumulated the counts for each
# hour, print out the counts, one per line, sorted by hour as shown below.
